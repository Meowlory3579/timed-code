# Timed Code Quiz

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to build a timed code quiz.

## User Story
AS A coding boot camp student  
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores  
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
* WHEN I click the start button, THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question.  
* WHEN I answer a question, THEN I am presented with another question.  
* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly, THEN time is subtracted from the clock.  
* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, THEN the game is over.  
* WHEN the game is over, THEN I can save my initials and score.


## The following video demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality
![Webpage titled "Coding Quiz Challenge" featuring quiz instructions and a button to Start the Quiz. Once the user starts the quiz, the timer begins to decrement and the user is presented with coding-related questions. For every question they answer incorrectly, additional time is removed from their score and the timer. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the user can input their initials and save their score.](https://github.com/Meowlory3579/random-password-generator/blob/main/assets/images/ezgif-7-80c2f64d7d.gif)
